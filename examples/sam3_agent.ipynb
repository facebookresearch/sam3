      "3. Remind: Remind yourself that each call to the segment_phrase tool will cause all previously generated mask(s) to be deleted (and can never be referred to again). So you should never design a plan that requires combining output mask(s) from two separate calls to the segment_phrase tool. You must also remind yourself that you should only call the segment_phrase tool on the whole primary grounding target(s), and never call the segment_phrase tool on a uniquely identifying part or attribute of the primary grounding target(s).\n",

      "5. Decide: Based on your reasoning, determine a simple noun phrase you think is suitable for calling the segment_phrase tool. The phrase should be a simple, direct, singular noun phrase.

      "The segment_phrase tool failed with \"blue vest person\", likely because the model doesn't recognize \"vest\" as a key term for segmentation. I should try a more general term like \"person\" first, then use select_masks_and_return to filter by vest color and position. Since the user specified \"rightmost\", I'll check if \"person\" generates all masks, then filter for the rightmost individual with blue vest.\n",
